# Portfolio site 101

## Brief:
Set up a (wireframe-like) portfolio-site in HTML and CSS.

The site should be responsive, and have versions for mobile, tablet and desktop.

The (initial) pages you need are:

* Frontpage / Homepage (index.html)
* My Work [with a list of projects, may be mocked up for now]
* About Me [with CV-style info]
* Contact Me [with at least a contact form]

Connect the site to a (new) Netlify site and add the Netlify-link to this Readme-file: [NAME OF YOUR SITE](URL-TO-YOUR-SITE)

## Requirements

All pages should have the same: 
1. A header with a logo/icon/image
2. A navigation menu
    * This should be collapsed into a hamburger menu on small devices
3. A footer with some relevant information
4. Use one common css-file with @media rules for responsivity

Home page should have, in addition to the above:
1. A (short form) About Me section (with read more link to About Me)
2. A (short) description of what you can do
3. A section with Â±3 "featured projects" (linking to My Work)

**Tip**: Make a quick scetch (on paper) where you decide how the elements on the page should "stack up" on mobile, tablet and desktop, respectivly, using (at least) the front page as an example.

## Technology

You may use CSS grid, Flexbox or old-school positioning/floats. 

**Tip**: Try using CSS grid for layout and Flexbox to position elements inside "the grid".
